"""Check a built wheel before it goes to PyPI, by running it.

Syntax and a file listing were all the old check did, which is how 0.4.32
shipped code that read a key its own function never returned: the module
imported cleanly and every safety rule underneath it was dead. So this
installs the wheel into a throwaway environment and asks it questions whose
answers it can verify.

Nothing here touches the operator's account, environment, or running bot:
it builds a temp venv, points HOME and the env file at a temp directory,
