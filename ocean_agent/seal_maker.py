"""Hourly pick-seal generator for the bracket trader.

Produces the seal file (outputs/내일예측_*.json) that bracket_trader
consumes. One pass does four things:

    score      every non-spot symbol gets an expected 24h move from its own
               recent bars, weighted by a per-class trust factor
    gate       only symbols whose live order book can absorb a $300 market
               order within the slippage cap are eligible
    direction  each pick goes long when its own 24h move sits at or above
               the cross-sectional median of all scored symbols, short below
    specials   up to two extra seats for funding-extreme symbols, taking the
               side that receives the funding payment

Bars come from public market-data endpoints only and each symbol's bars all
come from a single source: Binance USDT-margined futures klines when the
symbol has a futures listing there, Pacifica's own klines otherwise.
Sources are never mixed within one symbol. Market-hours underlyings are
represented only by their around-the-clock token bars; a token without
enough bar history is excluded rather than guessed at.

Nothing here places orders. The generator reads markets, prices, bars and
order books, then writes one JSON file.

# but its heat term is a PERCENTILE, which carries rank and throws away
# magnitude. Live trades show the cost of that: the ratio of actual to
# expected runs 0.69 in calm entries and 1.61 in hot ones, a slope wide of
# zero on two independent axes. No constant removes a slope.
#
# "atr28" drops the slow median and sizes straight off the current ATR,

# follows: at a matched width the replay improves 0.46 a day and the live

# requests where 74 used to do, and 2,183 of every 2,184 bars asked for are
# ones we already have on disk. The operator has said twice that the past
# belongs in the cache and only the new day should be fetched.
#
# So: read the cache, ask only for what comes after its last bar, write the
# merged series back. First run on a machine with the project cache tops up
# about a day; after that it is one or two bars an hour. A machine with no
# cache (a new install) falls through to the plain fetch and builds one.
#
# One source per symbol, unchanged, and the reason this does not simply
# read the Pacifica cache for everything even though that file is fresher
# and covers every listed symbol: a coin's size and side come from Binance
# bars, so its ranking must too. Mixing two venues inside one symbol was
