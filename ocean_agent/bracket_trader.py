"""The bracket trader: the measured operating plan, and nothing else.

Born 2026-08-11 from 430 measured variants. What it trades is NOT frozen
here: every number below lives in policy and has moved since, so read the
policy file, not this paragraph. As of 2026-08-28 it is

  · the top picks of the hourly seal by trade_rank, five seats in the
    operator's policy and eight in the shipped default
  · exit at TP 1.0x / SL 1.3x of the pick's expected move (08-26; it was
    0.3/1.0 at birth and 1.5/1.0 in between), or the 24h expiry
  · leverage capped by policy, isolated margin

Everything on the way out rests as a limit and none of it takes the market
(08-27): the stop triggers into a limit at its own price and a reduce-only
limit follows the mark if that is left behind, and the expiry exit rests
and re-posts. Market orders survive only where the position is already
unprotected or the user asked to flatten.

Deliberately absent, having been measured and rejected: swaps, a 12h
re-look (dilutes per-trade), trailing, partial TP. Intraday refills were
in that list until 08-14, when hourly seals replaced the daily one; empty
seats are now refilled, never exceeding the seat count.

Safety posture:
  · TP/SL ride on the exchange with the entry order, so a dead bot or PC
    cannot orphan a position without its lines.
  · The pre-registered breakers (liquidation, a bad running average, stops
    filling past their line) warn loudly instead of halting: 08-19 showed
    a halt is a silence, not a brake, because it waits for a console
    nobody reads while the account's real protection sits on the exchange.
  · Dry runs touch NOTHING on disk (review 5, BR1/BR4: a dry run once burned
    the day's seal and could even flip the halt flag; now it only logs).
  · Grading of closed trades reads the exchange's own realized pnl and cause,
    not a mark-price guess (BR3/BR11); the guess remains only as a fallback
    and errs to the stop, never the target.
  · The old EV bot (autonomous.py) is untouched; never run both at once. On
    entry, any symbol that already has a live exchange position - whoever
    opened it - is skipped (BR2).

Modes (2026-08-12): one account, two measured plans.
  · base - the validated plan (~80% TP-first-touch, ~60% profitable days)
  · hard - fixed ~3% target, wider swings (~56% win rate, larger total),
    NOT forward-validated yet; its settings live commented in
    policy_default.yaml
Each mode keeps its own state/record file so results never mix, and a live
run publishes a heartbeat so the other mode refuses to start next to it -
the same reasoning as the X1 guard against the old EV bot.

Run:  python -m ocean_agent.bracket_trader [--once] [--dry] [--status]

SEAL_POLL_SEC = 30

# ── seal self-generation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The trader consumes seals; seal_maker produces them. When no seal fresh
# enough exists, the loop generates one itself so a standalone install
# needs no external scheduler. At most one attempt per hour, and a failed
# generation only logs: position aftercare must never die with it.
# 2026-09-03 user decision: rebuild every half hour, not every hour.
# The board a seal carries is only as current as the seal, and with rules
# that read a fast signal the names go stale before the hour is out: on
# 09-03 the four Bollinger signals lit eight symbols at 12:48, five
# different ones by 13:30, and three by 17:24. A name that lights at 19:00
# and is dark again at 19:45 never reaches the file, so the seat is not
# entered late, it is lost.
#
# Late entry itself costs nothing measurable, which is why the interval and
# not the rule is what moves: replaying the signal with entry pushed one,
# two and three hours past the signal bar left both the fill price and the
# direction accuracy where they were. A band break is a mean-reversion
# call, so price drifts back toward the entry rather than away from it.
# What delay costs is seats, not price.
# How stale a seal may be before it is rebuilt. Two numbers, because the
# seal has two costs. When the operator's rules build the board themselves
# the seal skips its scoring and takes seconds (43.5s measured 09-04), and
# then the signal's own bar length is the right window: a 15m signal wants
# a quarter hour. When the board is scored the seal costs minutes (5m31s),
# and a quarter-hour window would leave it building a third of the time.
#
# Read off the last build rather than pinned, so switching modes cannot
# leave the wrong number behind. Half an hour until the first build tells
# us which mode we are in.
# 09-07: the quarter-hour branch is switched off, and the reason is the
# measurements rather than the build cost. The signal is a 1h Bollinger, so
# a fresh seal every fifteen minutes re-reads the same signal four times;
# what it actually changes is WHEN the entry happens. Every replay behind
# today's decisions enters two 15m bars (30 minutes) after the signal bar
# closes, which is what the live cadence measured at (median 34 min) when
# the seal ran on the half hour. Cutting the wait to fifteen minutes makes
# the running bot a different experiment from the one that was measured,
# and the delay is not free to move: the paired test put its value inside
# its own error bar, which is "cannot measure", not "no difference".
# Keep the constant and the branch: when the board comes back the build
# cost changes again, and the next person needs to see which knob is which.
